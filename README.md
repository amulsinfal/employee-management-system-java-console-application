# Employee Management System (Java Console Application)
This is a Java Console-based Employee Management System that I built using Core Java concepts and problem-solving approach. The application performes full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employees while applying proper input validation and exception handling.

The project demonstrates my understanding of:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ‚Äì modeling employees as real-world objects
2. Collections Framework ‚Äì managing dynamic employee records with ArrayList
3. Exception Handling ‚Äì ensuring invalid inputs don‚Äôt crash the program
4. Input Validation ‚Äì applying business rules like employee ID format, alphabet-only names, and positive salary

### üöÄ Features I Implemented

- Add new employees with details: ID, Name, Designation, Salary
- View all employees in the system
- Search for a specific employee by ID
- Sort the employee by name
- Update employee details (name, designation, salary)
- Delete an employee by ID
- Exit option to quit the system gracefully

### üõ†Ô∏è Validations I Added
1. Employee ID must follow the format E-<number> (Example: E-1, E-101)  
2. Name should contain only alphabets and spaces. (Example: Amul)
3. Salary must be greater than 0
4. If the input doesn't meet these rules then the system throws an error message.

### ‚ö° Tech Stack I Used
- Java (Core Java 21 compatible)  
- Scanner for user input  
- Collections (ArrayList) to store employee records  
- Exception Handling with built-in exception (IllegalArgumentException)
