# Employee Management System (Java Console Application)
This is a Java Console-based Employee Management System that I built using Core Java concepts and problem-solving approach. The application performes full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employees while applying proper input validation and exception handling.

The project demonstrates my understanding of:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ‚Äì modeling employees as real-world objects
2. Collections Framework ‚Äì managing dynamic employee records with ArrayList
3. Exception Handling ‚Äì ensuring invalid inputs don‚Äôt crash the program
4. Input Validation ‚Äì applying business rules like employee ID format, alphabet-only names, and positive salary

### üöÄ Features I Implemented

- Add new employees with details: ID, Name, Designation, Salary
- View all employees in the system
- Search for a specific employee by ID
- Sort the employee by name
- Update employee details (name, designation, salary)
- Delete an employee by ID
- Exit option to quit the system gracefully

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Validations I Added
1. Employee ID must follow the format E-<number> (Example: E-1, E-101)  
2. Name should contain only alphabets and spaces. (Example: Amul)
3. Salary must be greater than 0
4. If the input doesn't meet these rules then the system throws an error message.

### ‚ö° Tech Stack I Used
- Java (Core Java 21 compatible)  
- Scanner for user input  
- Collections (ArrayList) to store employee records  
- Exception Handling with built-in exception (IllegalArgumentException)

### üìå Class Explanations

1. Employee.java - This class defines the blueprint (model) of an employee.
   - This is a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class that represents a single employee.  
   - It contains fields (attributes) like id, name, designation, and salary.  
   - It provides getters and setters to access and modify these fields.  
   - A constructor initializes the object when it‚Äôs created.  
   - The toString() method is overridden so the employee details print in a readable format.  

2. EmployeeManagement.java - This class is the controller/manager that handles CRUD operations and business rules.  
   - This is the business logic class of the system.  
   - It uses a List<Employee> employees to store all employees in memory.
   - It provides methods to perform operations on employees:
     - addEmployee(Employee employee) ‚Üí Adds new employee (with validation).  
     - displayEmployees() ‚Üí Prints all employees.  
     - searchEmployee(String empId) ‚Üí Finds employee by ID.
     - updateEmployee(...) ‚Üí Updates name, designation, or salary of an employee.
     - deleteEmployee(String empId) ‚Üí Removes employee by ID.
     - sortEmployeesByName() ‚Üí Sorts employees alphabetically by name.
     - It also contains private validation methods (validateEmpId, validateEmpName, etc.) that ensure data integrity.

3. EmployeeManagementSystem.java - This class acts as the UI layer where the user interacts with the system.
   - This is the main entry point of the application (contains main() method).
   - It creates an object of EmployeeManagement and shows a menu-driven console UI using Scanner.
   - Users can select options like Add, Search, Update, Delete, Sort, etc.
   - It keeps running in a loop until the user chooses to Exit.
